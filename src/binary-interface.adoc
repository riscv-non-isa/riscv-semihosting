== RISC-V Semihosting Binary Interface

The RISC-V semihosting binary interface consist of a trap instruction
sequence and mechanism to pass parameters which are defined by the
following sub-sections.

=== Semihosting Trap Instruction Sequence

Semihosting operations are requested using a sequence of instructions
including `ebreak`. Because the RISC-V base ISA does not provide more than
one `ebreak` instruction, RISC-V semihosting uses a special sequence of
instructions to distinguish a semihosting `ebreak` from a debugger inserted
`ebreak`. The <<trap>> shows the instruction sequence used to invoke a
Semihosting operation.

.RISC-V Semihosting Trap Sequence
[#trap]
----
slli x0, x0, 0x1f   # 0x01f01013   Entry NOP
ebreak              # 0x00100073   Break to debugger
srai x0, x0, 7      # 0x40705013   NOP encoding the semihosting call number 7
----

These three instructions must be 32-bit-wide instructions, they may not be
compressed 16-bit instructions. This same sequence is used on all RISC-V
architectures. If paging is in use in the current mode, this sequence must
not cross a page boundary as the semihosting system must be able to check
for the semihosting sequence without needing data from potentially missing
pages. The <<function>> shows how this can be done by placing the sequence
in a separate function and aligning that to prevent that from spanning a
page boundary.

.RISC-V Semihosting Trap Function

        .option norvc
        .text
        .balign 16
        .global sys_semihost
        .type sys_semihost @function
sys_semihost:
        slli zero, zero, 0x1f
        ebreak
        srai zero, zero, 0x7
        ret

=== Semihosting Parameters

The type of semihosting operation and its parameter are specified using
general purpose registers. The <<register>> shows the specific registers
that are used, and the size of the fields in the data block, which depend
on whether the caller is 32-bit or 64-bit.
